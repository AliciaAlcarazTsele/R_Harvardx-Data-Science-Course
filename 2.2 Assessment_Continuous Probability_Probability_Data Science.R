#Questions 1 and 2: ACT scores, part 1
  #The ACT is a standardized college admissions test used in the United States. The four multi-part questions in this assessment all involve simulating some ACT test scores and answering probability questions about them.
  #For the three year period 2016-2018, ACT standardized test scores were approximately normally distributed with a mean of 20.9 and standard deviation of 5.7. (Real ACT scores are integers between 1 and 36, but we will ignore this detail and use continuous values instead.)

#Questions 1: First we'll simulate an ACT test score dataset and answer some questions about it.
  #Set the seed to 16, then use rnorm() to generate a normal distribution of 10000 tests with a mean of 20.9 and standard deviation of 5.7. Save these values as act_scores. You'll be using this dataset throughout these four multi-part questions.
  set.seed(16)
  act_scores <- rnorm(10000, 20.9, 5.7)

    #Question 1a: What is the mean of act_scores?
      m <- mean(act_scores)
      cat("1a Answer:", m, "\n")
      #Answer: 20.84012
    
    #Question 1b: What is the standard deviation of act_scores?
      s <- sd(act_scores)
      cat("1b Answer:", s, "\n")
      #Answer: 5.675237
      
    #Question 1c: A perfect score is 36 or greater (the maximum reported score is 36). In act_scores, how many perfect scores are there out of 10,000 simulated tests?
      sum_scores_greater <- function(a) sum(act_scores>=a)
      perfect_score <- sum_scores_greater(36)
      cat("1c Answer:", perfect_score, "\n")
      #Answer: 41
 
    #Question 1d: In act_scores, what is the probability of an ACT score greater than 30?
      sum_30_and_up_scores <- sum_scores_greater(30)
      Pr_1d <- sum_30_and_up_scores/10000
      cat("1d Answer:", Pr_1d, "\n")
      #Answer: 0.0527
      
    #Question 1e: In act_scores, what is the probability of an ACT score less than or equal to 10?
      sum_scores_lesser <- function(a) sum(act_scores<=a)
      sum_10_and_less_scores <- sum_scores_lesser(10)
      Pr_1e <- sum_10_and_less_scores/10000 
      cat("1e Answer:", Pr_1e, "\n")
      #Answer: 0.0282
  
          
#Question 2: Set x equal to the sequence of integers 1 to 36. Use dnorm to determine the value of the probability density function over x given a mean of 20.9 and standard deviation of 5.7; save the result as f_x. Plot x against f_x.
  x <- seq(1,36)
  f_x <- dnorm(x, 20.9, 5.7)
  qplot(x, f_x, geom = "line", main = "Question 2", xlab = "ACT Score", ylab = "Probability Density")
  cat("2 Answer: See Graph", "\n")
  #Answer: See Graph

  
#Questions 3: In this 3-part question, you will convert raw ACT scores to Z-scores and answer some questions about them.
  #Convert act_scores to Z-scores. Recall from Data Visualization (the second course in this series) that to standardize values (convert values into Z-scores, that is, values distributed with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1), you must subtract the mean and then divide by the standard deviation. Use the mean and standard deviation of act_scores, not the original values used to generate random test scores.
    z_f <- function(a) (a-m)/s
    z_scores <- z_f(act_scores) 
     
  #Question 3a: What is the probability of a Z-score greater than 2 (2 standard deviations above the mean)?
    sum_z_scores_greater <- function(a) sum(z_scores > a)
    sum_2_and_greater_z_scores <- sum_z_scores_greater(2)
    Pr_3a <- sum_2_and_greater_z_scores/10000
    cat("3a Answer:", Pr_3a, "\n")
    #Answer: 0.0233
  
  #Question 3b: What ACT score value corresponds to 2 standard deviations above the mean (Z = 2)?
    act_score_3b <- m+s*2
    cat("3b Answer:", act_score_3b, "\n")
    #Answer: 32.1906
      
  #Question 3c: A Z-score of 2 corresponds roughly to the 97.5th percentile. Use qnorm() to determine the 97.5th percentile of normally distributed data with the mean and standard deviation observed in act_scores. What is the 97.5th percentile of act_scores?
    act_score_3c <- qnorm(.975, m, s)
    cat("3c Answer:", act_score_3c, "\n")
    #Answer: 31.96338

    
#Questions 4: In this 4-part question, you will write a function to create a CDF for ACT scores.
  #Write a function that takes a value and produces the probability of an ACT score less than or equal to that value (the CDF). Apply this function to the range 1 to 36.
    CDF_act <- function(z) pnorm(z, m, s)
    score_range <- 1:36
    Pr_4 <- sapply(score_range, CDF_act)
    
  #Question 4a: What is the minimum integer score such that the probability of that score or lower is at least .95? (Your answer should be an integer 1-36.)
    Min_4a <- min(score_range[Pr_4 >= 0.95])
    cat("4a Answer:", Min_4a, "\n")
    #Answer: 31
      
  #Question 4b: Use qnorm() to determine the expected 95th percentile, the value for which the probability of receiving that score or lower is 0.95, given a mean score of 20.9 and standard deviation of 5.7. What is the expected 95th percentile of ACT scores?
    act_score_4b <- qnorm(.95, 20.9, 5.7)
    cat("4b Answer:", act_score_4b, "\n")
    #Answer: 30.27567
      
  #Question 4c: As discussed in the Data Visualization course, we can use quantile() to determine sample quantiles from the data. Make a vector containing the quantiles for p <- seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01), the 1st through 99th percentiles of the act_scores data. Save these as sample_quantiles. In what percentile is a score of 26? (Your answer should be an integer (i.e. 60), not a percent or fraction. Note that a score between the 98th and 99th percentile should be considered the 98th percentile, for example, and that quantile numbers are used as names for the vector sample_quantiles.)
    p <- seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01) 
    sample_quantiles <- quantile(act_scores, p)
    percentile_4c <- findInterval(26, sample_quantiles)
    cat("4c Answer:", percentile_4c, "\n")
    #Answer: 82
      
  #Question 4d: Make a corresponding set of theoretical quantiles using qnorm() over the interval p <- seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01) with mean 20.9 and standard deviation 5.7. Save these as theoretical_quantiles. Make a QQ-plot graphing sample_quantiles on the y-axis versus theoretical_quantiles on the x-axis.
    theoretical_quantiles <- qnorm(p, 20.9, 5.7)
    qplot(theoretical_quantiles, sample_quantiles, main = "Question 4a", xlab = "Theoretical Quantiles", ylab = "Sample Quantiles")
    cat("4d Answer: See Graph", "\n")
